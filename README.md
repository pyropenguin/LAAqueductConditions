Los Angeles Aqueduct Conditions

Real-time data from [https://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/ladwp/aboutus/a-water/a-w-losangelesaqueduct/a-w-laa-laaqueductconditionsreports], archived nightly.

I built this archive because I think itâ€™s interesting to watch water trends in the Owens Valley, and the real-time tool only provided 5 days worth of data. If you have any questions or concerns about this archive, please contact me:
